//The game of battleMage is played by writing a Java class to
//implement this character interface and then constructing an
//instance of your character in the arena to see how many increasingly
//tough opponents it can survive.
//
//WHO WILL WRITE THE STRONGEST BATTLEMAGE?!?!?
//
//To implement this interface, make sure of two things:
//
//1) your class header has "implements Character"
//e.g. "public class YourClass implements Character{..."
//and
//2) Your class must contain the methods listed below, using the signatures exactly
//as written here.
//
//Everything else is up to you!
public interface Character {

	// This method is where you declare which resource represents your character's
	// hit Points
	// This is the resource that will be reduced by unblocked threat
	// When this resource runs out, your character loses.
	public Resource getHitPointResource();

	// This method is your character's decision-making process. Using the passed
	// information about the
	// opponent and the current threat decide which action to take.
	// Construct and return your chosen action!
	//
	// Examine the Threat and Opponent classes to see which methods you can call
	// Examine the action classes (Attack, Block, MagicBlast, MagicShield) to see
	// how they work and how to construct them
	//
	// Remember, each action has a resource cost. You can initialize (in your
	// constructor) as many different resources as you
	// like, but the rule of the game is if you try to use resources that add up to
	// more than 200 in total, your character will be disqualified!
	public Action takeTurn(Threat threatInfo, Opponent oppInfo);
